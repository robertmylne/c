1. Using fork / spawn write a program that creates a copy of itself and then prints out “child cloned” and terminates.
2. The cloned program prints out either “hello daddy” or “where’s my daddy?” and terminates.

3. The parent program takes a command line integer argument that determines:
            - if it waits for the child to terminate before printing out the “child cloned” message or
            - if it prints it out as soon as the child is spawned.
4. A command line value of:
            - 1 means wait for the child message
            - 0 means print out before the child message
